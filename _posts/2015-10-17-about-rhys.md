I work on both printed and digital media, focusing on graphic design, web design and front end development. My field of work also includes photography, visual communication, campaign development as well as various other media communications.

\#\#\#Location

Currently I live in (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troms%C3%B8 text:Troms√∏, Norway popup:yes), where the sun never sets during summer and never rises during winter. This has been a "little challenging" as I'm from New Zealand and have lived in other sun filled places like Australia and Sweden.
